Cere Scan is a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors from MRI scans. The model classifies MRI images into four categories: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, or no tumor. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model development using advanced algorithms, and deployment on a user-friendly web interface. It aims to support medical experts by providing quick, preliminary diagnostic insights, improving accuracy and efficiency in brain tumor detection.
